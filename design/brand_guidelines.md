## 6. Layout & Spacing Philosophy

### Spacing Approach: **Breathing Room with Purpose**

The Rx Spot design should feel **spacious but not wasteful**, with intentional use of white space to convey premium quality and reduce cognitive overload.

### Modular Spacing Scale
- **4px** — Micro spacing (icon to text)
- **8px** — Tight spacing (form field internal padding)
- **12px** — Close spacing (related elements)
- **16px** — Default spacing (paragraph margins, card internal padding)
- **24px** — Medium spacing (between sections within a component)
- **32px** — Generous spacing (between distinct components)
- **48px** — Section spacing (mobile)
- **64px** — Section spacing (tablet)
- **80px** — Section spacing (desktop)

### Layout Tendencies

#### Section Structure
- **Full-width sections** with contained max-width content (`1280px` or `1440px`)
- **Alternating backgrounds:** White → Off-white → Light blue tint → White
- **Avoid:** Overly busy backgrounds; prefer clean or subtle gradients

#### Card Design
- **Rounded corners:** 12px - 16px border radius (modern but not overly round)
- **Subtle shadows:** Soft, layered shadows (not harsh drop shadows)
- **Hover states:** Gentle lift (translate Y -4px) + increased shadow
- **Internal padding:** 32px - 48px depending on card size

#### Grid Systems
- **Three-column layouts** for audience gateway cards
- **Two-column layouts** for text + image sections (B2B, opportunities)
- **Four-to-six column grids** for services/features (responsive to 2 cols on tablet, 1 col on mobile)

#### White Space vs. Density
- **Hero:** Generous vertical padding, centered content, breathing room
- **Content sections:** Balanced — not claustrophobic, not wasteful
- **Forms:** Adequate spacing between fields, clear visual grouping
- **Footer:** Compact but organized

## 7. Image Usage Guidelines

(Detailed asset usage is in `/design/image_manifest.md`)

### Logo Usage

#### The Rx Spot Logo
- **Primary placement:** Top-left of navigation bar
- **Size:** Approximately 120px - 150px wide (maintain aspect ratio)
- **Background considerations:** Logo has blue gradient background in asset; may need extraction for transparent navbar
- **Do not:** Distort, recolor outside brand palette, place on busy backgrounds that obscure detail

#### Logo Motif: Concentric Circles
- The logo's circular ring design can be **abstracted as a design motif** throughout the site:
  - Button radii and hover glows
  - Decorative background elements (faint concentric rings)
  - Icon badges and status indicators
  - Section dividers

### Photography Treatment

#### When to Use Photos
- **Hero section:** Lab/science imagery with gradient overlay to ensure text legibility
- **B2B sections:** Clinical precision imagery (well plates, lab equipment) to build credibility
- **Patient sections:** Human-focused imagery (patient with care, professional consultation)
- **Services:** Minimal or abstract — prefer icons/illustrations over photos to avoid clutter

#### How to Treat Photos
- **Overlay gradients:** Use dark-to-transparent or color-tinted overlays (20-60% opacity) to ensure text contrast
- **Blue color casts:** Acceptable and on-brand; lean into the blue theme
- **Avoid:** Cheesy stock photo smiles, overly staged scenarios, inconsistent color temperatures

#### Flyer Asset (`Teaser.png`)
- **DO NOT use as an inline image** on the website
- **DO extract messaging** for Business Opportunities section copy
- **DO reference visual structure** (pill-shaped cards) as design inspiration

### Abstract Backgrounds & Patterns

#### Approved Background Patterns
- **Radial gradients:** Subtle blue glows (from cyan accent color)
- **Linear gradients:** Deep blue to lighter blue, white to off-white
- **Medical cross motif:** Subtle, abstract crosses in background (inspired by flyer) at 5-10% opacity
- **Concentric rings:** Faint circular patterns echoing logo design

#### Avoid
- Busy textures that distract from content
- Stock "DNA helix" or "molecule" clip art (overused in medical sites)
- Animated backgrounds that draw focus from content

## 9. Motion & Animation Guidelines

The Rx Spot should feel **polished and smooth**, not hyperactive or gimmicky.

### Animation Principles
- **Subtle over flashy:** Prefer gentle fades and slides over bounces and spins
- **Purposeful motion:** Animations should guide attention, not distract
- **Performance-first:** Use CSS transforms (translate, scale) over position changes
- **Respect user preferences:** Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

### Approved Animation Types

#### Scroll-Triggered Reveals
- **Fade-in + slight Y-translation** (translate from +20px to 0)
- **Stagger delays** for card grids (50-100ms per card)
- **Trigger point:** When element is 10-20% into viewport

#### Hover States
- **Buttons:**
  - Primary: Background color shift + subtle scale (1.02-1.05) + shadow increase
  - Secondary: Border color shift + translate Y (-2px)
- **Cards:**
  - Subtle lift: translate Y (-4px to -8px)
  - Shadow increase: from subtle to medium
  - Border or accent color shift
- **Links:**
  - Underline slide-in effect
  - Color shift to accent blue

#### Hero Animations
- **Floating elements:** Slow, subtle vertical motion (5-10px range) on decorative blobs or icons
- **Background gradients:** Gentle shift or pulse (low opacity, slow duration)
- **Hero headline:** Fade-in with slight scale (0.98 → 1.0) on page load

#### Modal / Form Interactions
- **Modal open:** Fade-in backdrop + scale-in modal (0.95 → 1.0)
- **Modal close:** Reverse animation
- **Form field focus:** Border color shift + subtle glow (cyan accent)

### Animation Timing
- **Fast:** 150-200ms (hover states, button clicks)
- **Medium:** 300-400ms (card reveals, modal open/close)
- **Slow:** 600-800ms (hero elements, scroll reveals)
- **Easing:** `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` (smooth deceleration) or `ease-out`

### What to Avoid
- **Bounces, spins, or exaggerated motions** that feel unprofessional
- **Continuous infinite animations** that distract from content (except subtle background pulses)
- **Animations on every element** — be selective
