## Image Usage Strategy

### Hero Section
- **Primary Candidate:** `dmitrii-e-y10vO-Ic4OI-unsplash.jpg` (lab glassware with cyan neon)
- **Treatment:** Use as background with dark gradient overlay (bottom-to-top fade) to ensure text legibility
- **Rationale:** Immediately establishes scientific credibility, pharmacy/compounding theme, modern tech-forward aesthetic. Blue color aligns perfectly with brand.

### Three-Audience Gateway Cards
- **Patients Card:** `maxi-pezzarini-Bk_9ffil1zM-unsplash.jpg` (patient with oxygen) - subtle background or accent
- **B2B Card:** `martin-woortman-kDsx6GyUrQs-unsplash.jpg` (well plate) - represents precision and scale
- **Business Opportunities Card:** `andingomfoti-m-pr-ePkcBOfY-unsplash.jpg` (professional in mask) - business credibility

### Services Section
- **Option 1:** Use `afterave-essentials-j63WCKMzdiE-unsplash.jpg` (supplement bottle) as repeating background element with high opacity
- **Option 2:** Gradient backgrounds only, no photos (cleaner, more modern)

### B2B / Provider Section
- **Background or split-panel:** `martin-woortman-kDsx6GyUrQs-unsplash.jpg` (well plate) to emphasize pharmaceutical rigor
- **Alternative:** `andingomfoti-m-pr-ePkcBOfY-unsplash.jpg` for professional business context

### Business Opportunities Section
- **DO NOT use flyer image directly**
- **Extract messaging** from `Teaser.png` and recreate as native web section
- **Optional background:** Abstract blue gradient or subtle medical cross pattern inspired by flyer

## Design Motifs Observed

1. **Circular/Ring Patterns:** Logo uses concentric circles - can be echoed in UI elements (buttons, icons, decorative elements)
2. **Metallic Chrome Finish:** Logo's chrome-blue gradient could inspire button hover states, badges, premium UI elements
3. **Medical Cross Pattern:** Flyer background uses subtle crosses - could be abstracted for section backgrounds
4. **Pill/Capsule Shapes:** Flyer uses pill-shaped cards - excellent for CTA buttons and opportunity cards
5. **Blue Neon Glow:** Lab glassware image - can inspire glow effects on hover, focus states, accent lighting
6. **Grid/Precision:** Well plate image - represents accuracy, could inspire card layouts or data presentation

## Technical Notes

- All images available in three sizes: `originals/` (full-res), `processed/` (max 2400px, web-optimized), `thumbnails/` (max 800px, analysis-safe)
- All stock images are portrait or horizontal orientation - **no square crops available**
- Logo requires background extraction if transparent navbar needed
- Consider CSS blend modes and overlays for integrating photos with brand colors
- Flyer is informational asset - mine for content, not for direct image use
